ADDTIONAL MODULES
--------------------------------

Pathauto

Pathuauto was used to set a default URL alias for content based on the menu tree
[node:menu-link:parents:join-path]/[node:title]

Additional settings
Removed the word 'a' from Strings to Remove so that the alias for "Root A" would generate correctly.


ADDTIONAL NOTES
--------------------------------

URL aliases need to be regenerated when content is moved around in the menu structure to generate the correct alias and render the correct header.

Code was based in a Zen Subtheme.
